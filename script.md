I am working on a new tutorial video that is titled "Coding Fun: Build a Real-Time Connect Four Game with Playroom Kit + Phaser 3!". I currently have the following outline for the video:

Welcome everyone! Today we see how we can build a fun multiplayer connect four game using
the powerful phaser 3 framework and playroom kit.

Building html5 multiplayer games has never been easier, thanks to the playroom kit, which simplifies the development
of real-time web-based multiplayer games by offering seamless synchronization and state management features.
With its convenient integration capabilities, you can effortlessly incorporate the kit into popular game engines
and libraries, transforming any game into a multiplayer experience.

By combing playroom kit with phaser 3, we can easily create games like this:

In this video, we will take a look at how we can turn a simple connect four game into a fun multiplayer game
by integrating playroom kit into our code.

Having some experience with TypeScript and the Phaser 3 framework will be beneficial
but is not a hard requirement to follow along. In this video, we will not be going over the basics
of the phaser 3 framework, or typescript. if you are interested in learning more about phaser 3, I have
number of in depth tutorials on this topic (link to playlist appears).

Now that we have reviewed what we will be building, its time to get started!

At this point, I would transition to showing were the user can download the starting project template and provide
details on how to download and setup the project.

Rest of the video outline:
- review starting code and demo the local multiplayer
- review how to decouple code
- create abstract service class
- create local service instance
- review playroom kit features and documentation
- create playroom kit service instance
- wrap up code and test game


Could you please help provide suggestions for the video script and video title
